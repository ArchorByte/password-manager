# Password Manager
This terminal application allows you to store your password locally. <br/>
For your data safety, this password manager uses **AES-128 CBC** for the encryptions and decryptions. <br/>
Then, for your data integrity, the application uses **hex** and **Base64** to prevent data loss across operating systems.
> For Windows devices, verify your compiler path in the **build.bat** script before compilation.

# üì¶ Requirements
- CMake (**if you want to use the default build scripts**).
- OpenSSL.

# üì• Installation
1) Download the project. <br/>
2) Compile it. <br/>
3) Enjoy! <br/>

# ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation
The default compilation scripts (**build.sh** / **build.bat**) compile the entire project for you. Once the compilation is done, you can retrieve the executable at the following paths:
- `./build/win/out/pwd.exe` for Windows systems.
- `./build/linux/out/pwd` for Linux systems.

# ‚ùî How to use it
To use this software, you only need to run the executable, create a new account if you are running it for the first time, or simply log in if it's not. Then, you can freely create, show and remove passwords to your account!
