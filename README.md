# Password Manager
This terminal application allows you to store your password locally. <br/>
For your data safety, this password manager uses **AES-128 CBC** for the encryptions and decryptions. <br/>
Then, for your data integrity, the application uses **hex** and **Base64** to prevent data loss across operating systems.
> For Windows devices, verify your compiler path in the **build.bat** script before compilation.

# üì¶ Requirements
- CMake (**if you want to use the default build scripts**).
- OpenSSL.
